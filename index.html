        <p class="para1">This January celebrating new year with family, friends.
             New Year is celebrated all over the world with great enthusiasm and fun. 
             Earlier, it was a Roman calendar which was having only ten months and designated 1st
              march as the new year. In the Gregorian calendar, there are 12 months in every year 
              and the new year falls on January 1st which is widely accepted and celebrated the 
              festival.

        <p class="para5">I will take meditation class and start pacticing meditating at least 30 minutes everyday for the month. Hopefully, I will not fall asleep everytime I meditate. Meditation is often defined as thinking continuously about one object of thought. We often get stuck on this definition, however, and lose the real purpose of meditation. Meditation must reveal the true nature of that object upon which we are meditating. Such revelation comes not as a thought, but as a feeling. Therefore, meditation is a process in which we shift from thinking to feeling. It is a journey from the complexity of mind to the simplicity of heart. It is for this reason that most methods of meditation involve the heart.</p>
